# Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversial-Network-DCGAN-

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating realistic cat images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the AHFQ dataset and learns to generate new cat samples that resemble the training data. The model is trained on Google colabs T4 GPU. This project is performed to gain hands on experience on GANs and Pytorch library, the cats images are not much great but with proper hyper parameter tuning, it can be improved.

## Libraries used-
- Pytorch
- Os
- Matplotlib
